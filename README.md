# C++ class - Unique Random Numbers
It can compute an unique int or float between a given range. Don't forget to init once srand at the beginning of your program.<br>
*Warning: Initing srand several times along the program can mess up the process of computing an unique random number.*

```c++
srand( time( NULL ) );
```

There's not so much fanciness here.
